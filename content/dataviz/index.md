Below are some "extra-curricular" data vizualizations I'm especially proud of.

I handled technical implementation to produce the animation below, in a joint effort with Joanne Sherrod. It was featured in <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90492485/this-detailed-map-graph-traces-a-damning-trump-timeline-as-covid-19-spread-through-the-u-s">Fast Company</a>, tweeted by AFT president <a href="https://twitter.com/rweingarten/status/1252410845557997568?s=20">Randi Weingarten</a>, and shared on Facebook more than 7,000 times. You can find the code on my <a href="https://github.com/JoeMitchellNelson/Covid-19-map">Github</a>.
