Below are some "extra-curricular" data vizualizations I'm especially proud of.

Some recent studies have found significant effects of COVID-19 lockdowns on air quality, especially in cities like <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7189867/">Delhi</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720326024">Rio de Janeiro</a>, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lanplh/PIIS2542-5196(20)30107-8.pdf">Wuhan</a>. I was curious to see if similar effects were apparent in urban areas in the U.S., so I plotted 2020's PM$_{2.5}$ data for New York City, compared to recent years. The code and data to produce this plot are on my <a href="https://github.com/JoeMitchellNelson/pm25_covid">Github</a>.

I handled technical implementation to produce the animation below, in a joint effort with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jo-sherrod-50975014/">Joanne Sherrod</a>. It was featured in <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90492485/this-detailed-map-graph-traces-a-damning-trump-timeline-as-covid-19-spread-through-the-u-s">Fast Company</a>, tweeted by AFT president <a href="https://twitter.com/rweingarten/status/1252410845557997568?s=20">Randi Weingarten</a>, and shared on Facebook more than 7,000 times. You can find the code on my <a href="https://github.com/JoeMitchellNelson/Covid-19-map">Github</a>.
